# PV204 Imrich Nagy & Daniel Rychlý
Repository for PV204 course semestral project @ Faculty of Informatics, Masaryk University

The project consists of analyzing security certificates, then implementing PIN-authenticated secure communication over insecure channel using ephemeral Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman protocol and finally, reviewing the implementations of the other teams.

# Sources
Card Tools used to connect and communicate with the card were made by Petr Švenda (https://github.com/petrs) and Dušan Klinec (https://github.com/ph4r05). APDU program and the Applet are based on their work as well.

All the functionality is based on Oracle Java documentation and Oracle Java Card framework and documentation.
